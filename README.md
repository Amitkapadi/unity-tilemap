# Tilemap
A simple yet highly customisable tile mapping tool made for the Unity Engine

## How do I make my own tiles?
In the project window click on _Create > Tilemap > Tiles_ and select a tile type to create. You can edit the tiles variables by just clicking on it, like anyother asset.

If you want to create your own tile behaviours (Like the AutoTile) then click on _Create > Tilemap > Tiles > Create C# Tile Script_ and edit like anyother script.
